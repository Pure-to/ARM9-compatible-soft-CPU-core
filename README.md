# ARM9-compatible-soft-CPU-core
This ARMv4-compatible CPU core is built in synthesiable verilog.It could launch uCLinux and Linux in MODELSIM. It has high Dhrystone benchmark value: 1.2 DMIPS/MHz.  It could be utilized in your FPGA design as one submodule, if you master the interface of this .v file.  This IP core is very compact. It is one .v file and has only less 1800 lines.
